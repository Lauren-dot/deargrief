<h2>The First Seven Days. 
    <p>Retelling of the story of death, of life, of love: </p>
    <p>Creating the opportunity to rebuild your relationship with your grief.</p>
</h2>

<p>
    In many ways, grief is love, unreturned. Grief is what we feel when relationships change. Death, as the ultimate change, can bring on intense grief. Grief leaves us feeling exposed, unprotected from the emotional tempest around us, demolished when we could most use the strong support system and warm comfort your loved one helped you build for yourself. In this circumstance, it is tempting to retreat away from the ruins of your emotional estate. But the thing about grief is, the more you allow yourself to feel, the more practiced your brain can become at handling those feelings. Your brain is an amazing organ; like many parts of the body, it has the natural ability to help itself heal. If you give it the right conditions, such as opportunity to slowly strengthen itself and the investment of your time. In the words of grief expert Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross: “The reality is that you will grieve forever. You will not 'get over' the loss of a loved one; you will learn to live with it. You will heal and you will rebuild yourself around the loss you have suffered. You will be whole again but you will never be the same. Nor should you be the same nor would you want to.” 
Over the course of the next week, each day, you will tell me, your journal, the story of the death of your beloved. Again and again. This may seem impossibly difficult now; but it is important because it will allow your brain the repeated opportunities it needs to process what was once inconceivable - a life without the person you love. Over the course of this practice, you may notice that how you tell the story of the death and how you found out about the death changes which each telling. This is not a result of your memory lapsing; this is your mind working on finding a way to understand the inconceivable. Our goal in this journal is to empower your mind to do this.
Another metaphor: Think of your mind as a backpack. Within it, you can find all of your memories and feelings. You carry it with you wherever you go. When death occurs, it is as though someone suddenly drops a terribly heavy weight into your backpack; so heavy that it knocks you over, tumbling down to the ground. Death’s sudden entrance knocks your proverbial papers out of your backpack, throwing them all over the road. And that weight crumpled everything else in your well-organized backpack. 
Healthy grieving is the time and space you need to put all of your thrown-about items back into your pack, reorder them, and then re-adjust the straps so you are better able to carry this new weight. When grief is (eventually) well processed, the love you felt and still feel for the deceased is easy to carry in your proverbial emotional backpack. It is something that you always carry with you. But it is something that you are able to carry; it does not break your back or stop you from eventually moving forward on your life’s journey. Like water you need as you hike, it might be a bit heavy but that loving connection is also something that sustains you. Only once you complete this difficult task, can you continue on your life’s journey. But that means you need to  take the time to look at all your metaphorical memory papers anew, deciding where to organize them so that you can bear this new weight of your changed love; so you can walk steadily forward on your life’s path. This process takes time, patience, and effort. 
The purpose of this journal is not to scrub your loss out of your mind, leaving their memory and your love for them exclusively on these pages. Rather, it is an exercise which enables your mind to start to both consciously and subconsciously process the death, to better place it in your mind’s backpack. It is one tool (of many) that can help your mind naturally guide itself through the five stages of grief, towards acceptance of the impossible - a life without your beloved. 
Within traditional Judaism, the mourners participate in “shiva”, meaning “seven”. During each of these days, visitors - friends, family, community members - come and sit with the bereaved. While every mourner has the choice to not participate in any conversation, the result of these gatherings is that, by the end of the seven days of intense mourning, the bereaved often have told and re-told the story of the death seven (or more) times. 
In today’s world, in which families, friends, and even entire communities are no longer a few doors away, this kind of shiva is much harder to do. This journal is structured as a tool you can use in your grieving process. While no book can be a substitute for human contact, this journal is intended to help you engage in this kind of traditional grief-healing at your own pace, in your own space.
The first seven days of this journal will ask you to retell the story of your loved one’s death. This will be difficult - and sometimes feel repetative - but this process is designed to help your mind transition into your new reality: a world without your loved one.
The rest of the journal gives space not just for their death, but also to tell stories about their life.

<h2>A Note Before We Begin the Next 60 Days.</h2>
<p>
As you walk through this process, I want to remind you one last thing. Every color of the rainbow of feelings, in every intensity, is all accepted here. It is alright to feel guilt or happiness or sadness. It is natural to feel relief. It is okay to experience any one of the rainbow of feelings to the fullness of their depths, just as it is also normal to feel nothing. We often feel guilt, anger, or additional sadness when we acknowledge the complex feelings about the person we lost. They were not perfect; nor are you, or any of us. It turns out that they are only human; their death does not change that (in fact, it is one of the few things that all human beings have in common). And your relationship wasn’t perfect, because no relationship is. Maybe you are angry, maybe you are hurt, maybe your mind is reeling with one or a variety of “could’ve, should’ve would’ve”moments.  That is okay. Notice and acknowledge the feelings, but also train your heart to see that human relationships are messy, sometimes ugly, and frustrating ties; and that we are eternally grateful for them. Relationships teach us who we are and how big we are able to love. 
Guilt about the rainbow of your feelings and their complexity often asks you to suffer even more. You do not need to accept its invitation. Notice the guilt, acknowledge it, and then ask the guilt to make space in your head and heart for the other feelings you would rather pay attention to right now. If you feel guilt or other difficult emotions flooding over you, overwhelming you, remind yourself: you did the best you could at the time. Maybe it isn’t your best now, but it was your best then. And that is okay. If or when your relationship is at peace, take this for what it is: a true blessing. What is important is that you are learning how to become an observer of these feelings, no matter their intensity. This allows you to swim in the ocean of your feelings, observing the tides, and enabling you to, perhaps, better control your deepest dives. 
All of this takes a bit of time and work. That is okay. <i>You can do hard things.</i>

<h2>Why is Momentary Monitoring Important?</h2>
<p>
Learning how to quickly "take your emotional temperature" is a skill. 
It is infinately useful in your day to day, but also particularly through your grief process. It empowers you to spend a moment to observe yourself, your actions, and the feelings that motivated them. Were you functional today or not? Were you able to experience moments of a variety of emotions beyond sadness and anger or not? 
By using this tool quickly, this information, slight though it may seem on the surface, gives a moment of insight into your intuition and subconcious mind. Living in the 0-3 area is normal for parts of grief, but if it lasts your whole 60 days here, that is an indication that it is time to <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/therapists/">access more personalized help</a>.
