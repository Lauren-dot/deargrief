7   “Climb the mountains and get their good tidings. Nature's peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees. The winds will blow their own freshness into you, and the storms their energy, while cares will drop away from you like the leaves of Autumn.” - John Muir, The Mountains of California
This is the seventh day of your mourning journal. Take yourself outside. This can be as simple as a walk around the block or as involved as a hike in the nearby woods. Allow yourself the mental space to reflect exclusively on the change of surroundings. You have permission to ask all of your thoughts and feelings to stand on the sidelines. Focus, even for just one minute, on the crispness of the air, the sensation of the sunshine or rain on your face, the smell of the earth around you. Write about this moment here.
